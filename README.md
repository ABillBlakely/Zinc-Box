# RIAA Preamp

### The feature complete RIAA preamp

## Introduction

This RIAA preamp was meant to be a simple, high performance preamp for my personal use.
Version 1 was named the feature complete version because it had none of the typical features of most riaa preamps. The usual features are gain control and input impedance matching. 

Version 2, the current development, is being developed as a kit for the Cal Poly AES club and is intended to be sold as a kit. Version 2 may roll in some of the features that were missing from V1 and will include many improvements electrically and mechanically.
